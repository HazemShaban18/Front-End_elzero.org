- [x] Quirks Mode

> Quirks mode is a technique used by many web browsers for maintaining backward compatibility with web pages designed for old web browsers instead of strictly complying with W3C standards. In Quirks mode, the internet browser tries to interpret on ‘best-guess’, this associated with a general understanding of code that might be not well structured, non-standard, or ineffectively written implies your page is running without a type declaration. The general purpose of quirks mode is that it’s a compatibility mode for IE5. This intends that as well as changing the layout mode, it additionally turns off most of the browser features that have been created since IE5. In quirks mode, browsers accept and behave like in the early days of the web. It accepts any badly formatted, malformed mark-up in this mode and is not strict with syntax, tags, and elements of it. This was done to avoid breaking old sites too much in new browsers.

- [x] HTML Meta List

> HTML lets you specify metadata - additional important information about a document in a variety of ways. The META elements can be used to include name/value pairs describing properties of the HTML document, such as author, expiry date, a list of keywords, document author etc.

> The meta tag is used to provide such additional information. This tag is an empty element and so does not have a closing tag but it carries information within its attributes.

> You can include one or more meta tags in your document based on what information you want to keep in your document but in general, meta tags do not impact physical appearance of the document so from appearance point of view, it does not matter if you include them or not.

- [x] HTML Rendering Mode

> There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: quirks mode, almost standards mode, and full standards mode. In quirks mode, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. This is essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web standards. In full standards mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications. In almost standards mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.
